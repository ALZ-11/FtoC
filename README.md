# Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion: Accurate vs. Approximate

Welcome to the **Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion** mini-project. In this repo, we compare two methods for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:
1. **The Accurate Formula**: $`C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32) `$
2. **The Approximate Formula**: $`C \approx \frac{1}{2} \times (F - 32) `$

We dive into how the approximation performs compared to the accurate conversion, and how the error behaves at specific Fahrenheit values.

## Key Features

- **Accurate vs. Approximate Conversion**: Understand the difference and where the approximation works best.
- **Error Analysis**: Visualize the error pattern between both methods.
- **Insight**: Discover the unexpected regularity in the error increments.

## The Math (Just the Essentials)

### Accurate Formula:
The accurate conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:
$`
C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32)
`$

### Approximate Formula:
A simplified method is:
$`
C \approx \frac{1}{2} \times (F - 32)
`$

### Absolute Error:
We calculate the absolute error between both methods:
$`
\text{Absolute Error} = \left| \frac{5}{9} (F - 32) - \frac{1}{2} (F - 32) \right|
`$

This error increases predictably at **specific Fahrenheit values**, especially every **$`36°F `$** from the focal point of **$`32°F`$**. For example, at **$`68°F`$**, **$`104°F`$**, and so on, the error increments in **$`2°C`$ steps**.

## Interactive Graphs

- Graphs comparing the results of both conversion methods.
- Error graphs highlighting key points where the error increases by **$`2°C`$** every **$`36°F`$** from 32°F.

These plots give us a visual insight into the regularity of the error and how far apart the two methods diverge.


## Fact

The error increments by **$`2°C`$** at **$`36°F`$ intervals** from the focal point of **$`32°F`$**. This means you can use mental math to make small adjustments to your conversion when approximating the Celsius value.

**Example**:
- At **$`68°F`$**, add **$`2°C`$**.
- At **$`104°F`$**, add **$`4°C`$**.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or any compatible environment)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** 

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
